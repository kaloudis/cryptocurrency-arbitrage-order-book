# Cryptocurrency Arbitrage Order Book

This app pulls ETH, XMR, ZEC, and LTC order books from Bittrex, Poloniex, and Binance, combines the order data and points out any arbitrage opportunities.

## TODO
- Account for any additional exchange-related fees
- Unit Tests
- Add a depth chart (perhaps with React Stockcharts)
- Typescript
- Add more exchanges
- Add more currencies
- Allow for base-pairs other than BTC
- Quicker finds with websockets
